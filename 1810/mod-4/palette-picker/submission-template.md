 # Code Quality

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/bld010/frontend-palette-picker/blob/master/src/App.js#L29)

 * Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
- Lines 29-36: This was a turning point in the project. There is a lot of heavy lifting that happens in this function and it all happens asychronously, which is a newer concept for us. This function is bundled and called a few times in the app. When this function was written and achieved we knew that we saw daylight at the end of the tunnel. Additionally, the testing of this particular function was beastly and was a great opportunity for learning.

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/bld010/frontend-palette-picker/blob/master/src/Palettes.js#L35)

 * Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
- Lines 35 and 39: These classNames are not doing a whole lot here. There were some complications in testing and trying to find particular elements and throwing a className on them was the cheapest and fastest way to get it done, but there is a better solution out there. Separately, our git branches and commits, turned into a bit of a tangled web.

 #### Link to Design Inspiration

- We really enjoyed the simple circles on the palette. We took the opportunity to add them to our project via the Mini-Palette display. We thought that it would be a good juxtaposition against the rectagular palettes above. We also enjoyed the less-is-more approach to the background, which emphasizes the colors and takes nothing away.

 #### Reflection on New Concepts

 * Describe your thoughts on server-side testing  
- Server-side testing went by quickly. Almost, too quick. As in, We know that we have happy and sad paths for all things, but it seems like there may need to be more tests written. 
* Describe your thoughts on TravisCI  
- The initial set-up was difficult, and we will go through the process again with future projects, but once the technology was implemented it was a great way of triple-checking production-level code.
* Describe your thoughts in creating a single project whose codebase was distributed across multiple repositories
- We knew that there were going to be challenges, but met those challenges with enthusiasm and curiousity. Thus, we prevailed.
